# Async Comprehension

This project contains tasks for learning to use asynchronous comprehensions in Python 3.

## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0. **Async Generator**<br/>[0-async_generator.py](0-async_generator.py) contains an asynchronous coroutine called `async_generator` that takes no arguments and meets the following requirements:
  + The coroutine will loop 10 times, each time asynchronously wait 1 second, then yield a random number between 0 and 10.
  + Use the `random` module.

+ [x] 1. **Async Comprehensions**<br/>[1-async_comprehension.py](1-async_comprehension.py) contains a script that meets the following requirements:
  + Import `async_generator` from the previous task and then write a coroutine called `async_comprehension` that takes no arguments.
  + The coroutine will collect 10 random numbers using an async comprehensing over `async_generator`, then return the 10 random numbers.

+ [x] 2. **Run time for four parallel comprehensions**<br/>[2-measure_runtime.py](2-measure_runtime.py) contains a script that meets the following requirements:
  + Import `async_comprehension` from the previous file and write a `measure_runtime` coroutine that will execute `async_comprehension` four times in parallel using `asyncio.gather`.
  + `measure_runtime` should measure the total runtime and return it.
