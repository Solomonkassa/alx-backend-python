## Tasks To Complete

+ [x] 0. **Parameterize a unit test**<br/>[test_utils.py](test_utils.py) contains a python module that meets the following requirements:
  + Familiarize yourself with the `utils.access_nested_map` function and understand its purpose. Play with it in the Python console to make sure you understand.
  + In this task you will write the first unit test for `utils.access_nested_map`.
  + Create a `TestAccessNestedMap` class that inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
  + Implement the `TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map` method to test that the method returns what it is supposed to.
  + Decorate the method with `@parameterized.expand` to test the function for following inputs:
    ```
    nested_map={"a": 1}, path=("a",)
    nested_map={"a": {"b": 2}}, path=("a",)
    nested_map={"a": {"b": 2}}, path=("a", "b")
    ```
  + For each of these inputs, test with `assertEqual` that the function returns the expected result.
  + The body of the test method should not be longer than 2 lines.

+ [x] 1. **Parameterize a unit test**<br/>[test_utils.py](test_utils.py) contains a python module that meets the following requirements:
  + Implement `TestAccessNestedMap.test_access_nested_map_exception`. Use the `assertRaises` context manager to test that a `KeyError` is raised for the following inputs (use `@parameterized.expand`):
    ```
    nested_map={}, path=("a",)
    nested_map={"a": 1}, path=("a", "b")
    ```
  + Also make sure that the exception message is as expected.

+ [x] 2. **Mock HTTP calls**<br/>[test_utils.py](test_utils.py) contains a python module that meets the following requirements:
  + Familiarize yourself with the `utils.get_json` function.
  + Define the `TestGetJson(unittest.TestCase)` class and implement the `TestGetJson.test_get_json` method to test that `utils.get_json` returns the expected result.
  + We donâ€™t want to make any actual external HTTP calls. Use `unittest.mock.patch` to patch `requests.get`. Make sure it returns a `Mock` object with a `json` method that returns `test_payload` which you parametrize alongside the `test_url` that you will pass to `get_json` with the following inputs:
    ```
    test_url="http://example.com", test_payload={"payload": True}
    test_url="http://holberton.io", test_payload={"payload": False}
    ```
  + Test that the mocked `get` method was called exactly once (per input) with `test_url` as argument.
  + Test that the output of `get_json` is equal to `test_payload`.

+ [x] 3. **Parameterize and patch**<br/>[test_utils.py](test_utils.py) contains a python module that meets the following requirements:
  + Read about memoization and familiarize yourself with the `utils.memoize` decorator.
  + Implement the `TestMemoize(unittest.TestCase)` class with a `test_memoize` method.
  + Inside `test_memoize`, define the following class:
    ```py
    class TestClass:

        def a_method(self):
            return 42

        @memoize
        def a_property(self):
            return self.a_method()
    ```
  + Use `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `a_method`. Test that when calling `a_property` twice, the correct result is returned but `a_method` is only called once using `assert_called_once`.

+ [x] 4. **Parameterize and patch as decorators**<br/>[test_client.py](test_client.py) contains a python module that meets the following requirements:
  + Familiarize yourself with the `client.GithubOrgClient` class.
  + Declare the `TestGithubOrgClient(unittest.TestCase)` class and implement the `test_org` method.
  + This method should test that `GithubOrgClient.org` returns the correct value.
  + Use `@patch` as a decorator to make sure `get_json` is called once with the expected argument but make sure it is not executed.
  + Use `@parameterized.expand` as a decorator to parametrize the test with a couple of `org` examples to pass to `GithubOrgClient`, in this order:
    + `google`.
    + `abc`.
  + No external HTTP calls should be made.

+ [x] 5. **Mocking a property**<br/>[test_client.py](test_client.py) contains a python module that meets the following requirements:
  + `memoize` turns methods into properties. Read up on how to mock a property.
  + Implement the `test_public_repos_url` method to unit-test `GithubOrgClient._public_repos_url`.
  + Use `patch` as a context manager to patch `GithubOrgClient.org` and make it return a known payload.
  + Test that the result of `_public_repos_url` is the expected one based on the mocked payload.

+ [x] 6. **More patching**<br/>[test_client.py](test_client.py) contains a python module that meets the following requirements:
  + Implement `TestGithubOrgClient.test_public_repos` to unit-test `GithubOrgClient.public_repos`.
  + Use `@patch` as a decorator to mock `get_json` and make it return a payload of your choice.
  + Use `patch` as a context manager to mock `GithubOrgClient._public_repos_url` and return a value of your choice.
  + Test that the list of repos is what you expect from the chosen payload.
  + Test that the mocked property and the mocked `get_json` was called once.

+ [x] 7. **Parameterize**<br/>[test_client.py](test_client.py) contains a python module that meets the following requirements:
  + Implement `TestGithubOrgClient.test_has_license` to unit-test `GithubOrgClient.has_license`.
  + Parametrize the test with the following inputs:
    ```
    repo={"license": {"key": "bsd-3-clause"}}, license_key="bsd-3-clause"
    repo={"license": {"key": "bsl-1.0"}}, license_key="bsd-3-clause"
    ```
  + You should also parameterize the expected returned value.

+ [x] 8. **Integration test: fixtures**<br/>[test_client.py](test_client.py) contains a python module that meets the following requirements:
  + We want to test the `GithubOrgClient.public_repos` method in an integration test. That means that we will only mock code that sends external requests.
  + Create the `TestIntegrationGithubOrgClient(unittest.TestCase)` class and implement the `setUpClass` and `tearDownClass` which are part of the `unittest.TestCase` API.
  + Use `@parameterized_class` to decorate the class and parameterize it with fixtures found in [fixtures.py](fixtures.py). The file contains the following fixtures:
    ```
    org_payload, repos_payload, expected_repos, apache2_repos
    ```
  + The `setupClass` should mock `requests.get` to return example payloads found in the fixtures.
  + Use `patch` to start a patcher named `get_patcher`, and use `side_effect` to make sure the mock of `requests.get(url).json()` returns the correct fixtures for the various values of `url` that you anticipate to receive.
  + Implement the `tearDownClass` class method to stop the patcher.

+ [x] 9. **Integration tests**<br/>[test_client.py](test_client.py) contains a python module that meets the following requirements:
  + Implement the `test_public_repos` method to test `GithubOrgClient.public_repos`.
  + Make sure that the method returns the expected results based on the fixtures.
  + Implement `test_public_repos_with_license` to test the `public_repos` with the argument `license="apache-2.0"` and make sure the result matches the expected value from the fixtures.
